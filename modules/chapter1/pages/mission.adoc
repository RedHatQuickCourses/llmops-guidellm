= Your Place in the Adventure

Welcome, AI Operator! Before you dive into benchmarking with GuideLLM, it's important to see the bigger picture. This course is a critical first step in a larger learning adventure designed to make you a master of the "AI Factory"â€”a system where you control the balance between **Performance, Accuracy, and Cost**.

=== Your Mission Log

This entire learning path is a series of missions. Your current objective is the crucial starting point for all that follows.

* **This Mission: Model Performance Benchmarking with GuideLLM**
+
--
Your task is to master the art of measurement. Before you can improve anything, you must first establish a baseline. You will learn to answer the question: "Is this model fast enough for my application?"

* **Mission 2: Evaluating Model Accuracy with lm-eval-harness**
* **Mission 3: Optimizing vLLM Performance**
* **Mission 4: Model Quantization with LLM Compressor**

=== The Rules of Engagement

A quick piece of intel: these labs are blueprints, not paint-by-numbers exercises. They are based on real-world patterns from successful customer engagements. You will be starting with a standard, resource-limited OpenShift AI environment.

Your challenge is to **adapt these blueprints**. You will have to think like an operator, figuring out how to make these tools work within your constraints to achieve your goals.

Your first mission is to master the art of measurement. Let's get started with setting up your first benchmark.
